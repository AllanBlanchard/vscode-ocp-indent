# OCP Indent

## Features

Provides OCP indent formatting for Ocaml.

- full file formatting
- selected text formatting

Note that the behavior of the full file formatting can be configured. If:

- OcpIndent: Global Format Takes Selection

is activated, if some text is selected, the behavior is the same as "selected text formatting".
Basically: the same key binding can be used for both actions.

## Requirements

- `ocp-indent` (`opam install ocp-indent`)
